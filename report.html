                    1. The URL to the github project can be found <a href="https://github.com/343F23/project-phase-1-cs343project.git">here</a>.<br>
                    2. The site is published and can be found <a href="https://343f23.github.io/project-phase-1-cs343project/">here</a>.<br>
                    3. You're looking at it! üçª <br>
                    4. The 5 separate pages (not including this one) are as follows:<br>
                    &emsp;<a href="index.html" target="_blank">Home Page (header)</a><br>
                    &emsp;<a href="login/index.html" target="_blank">"Log in" Page</a><br>
                    &emsp;<a href="signup/index.html" target="_blank">"Sign up" Page</a><br>
                    &emsp;<a href="termsandconditions/index.html" target="_blank">Terms & conditions Page</a><br>
                    &emsp;<a href="conceptapp/index.html" target="_blank">App concept draft</a><br>
                    5. The header is the home page<br>
                    6. At the moment all of the pages can access eachother<br>
                    7. Most of the site is compatible with any reasonable size. For example, the site logo often overlapped text during development, but that has been fixed
                    with padding and the usage of a vw unit. And the text and other objects are built through bootstrap to withstand wonky resizing. <br>
                    8. The logo counts as an image (right?) the alt is appropriate too.
                    9.
