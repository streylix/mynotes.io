                <blockquote>
                    1. The URL to the github project can be found <a href="https://github.com/343F23/project-phase-1-cs343project.git">here</a>.<br>
                    2. The site is published and can be found <a href="https://343f23.github.io/project-phase-1-cs343project/">here</a>.<br>
                    3. You're looking at it! üçª <br>
                    4. The 5 separate pages (not including this one) are as follows:<br>
                    &emsp;<a href="index.html" target="_blank">Home Page (header)</a><br>
                    &emsp;<a href="login/index.html" target="_blank">"Log in" Page</a><br>
                    &emsp;<a href="signup/index.html" target="_blank">"Sign up" Page</a><br>
                    &emsp;<a href="termsandconditions/index.html" target="_blank">Terms & conditions Page</a><br>
                    &emsp;<a href="conceptapp/index.html" target="_blank">App concept draft</a><br>
                    5. The header is the home page<br>
                    6. At the moment all of the pages can access eachother<br>
                    7. Most of the site is compatible with any reasonable size. For example, the site logo often overlapped text during development, but that has been fixed
                    with padding and the usage of a vw unit. And the text and other objects are built through bootstrap to withstand wonky resizing. <br>
                    8. The logo counts as an image (right?) the alt is appropriate too. <br>
                    9. For the most part. The header page does does not have a header and the big "mynotes.io" text is just a text div that's enlarged. Will fix in phase 2.
                    Also, the labels in the login/signup I'm not sure why I need that, I tried adding it but it made more errors so I'll leave it as is for now.<br>
                    10. I had two fonts at one point, but that save was on a different device and it never successfully pushed. Quick fix - will be added shortly after this is due.<br>
                    11. Forms are shown in the login and sign up pages
                    12. Links to external sites? Not sure what this is supposed to mean. If it means what I think it is and is just links to other pages in the site, then yes. If it's supposed to mean links to something like picsum, then no.<br>
